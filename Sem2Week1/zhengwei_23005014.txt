My name is CHEW ZHENG WEI with matrix number, 23005014. 
I am majoring in MULTIMEDIA COMPUTING. 
This is my first time taking the Data Structure subject. 
At the moment, I am feeling EXCITED about taking this subject. 
This is because I LOVE CODING.
I acquired B for my previous Programming 1 course. 
Itâ€™s not too bad. 
So, I think I can manage to get A+ for this DS subject this term. 
In order to do well in the subject, I will STUDY HARD. Wish me luck!!!
