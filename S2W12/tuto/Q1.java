     *  A binary search tree (BST) is a way to organize a bunch of data where each item has a value, and the tree helps you quickly find a specific item by comparing its value to the values of the items in the tree.
        BST is called "binary" because each item can have at most two child items.
        BST is organized so that each item's value is greater than the value of its left child, and less than the value of its right child.
        This makes it easy to narrow down your search for a specific item as you move through the tree.
