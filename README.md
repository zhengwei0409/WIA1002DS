## week1 - Object-oriented programming (OOP)
This week, we're revisiting S1 concepts such as classes and objects, exploring how to utilize abstract classes, understanding class interfaces, and delving into the concept of polymorphism.  

## week2 - Generics
Generics enable us to parameterize types < E > and detect errors at compile time rather than at runtime.  
We learn about how to create generic classes and interfaces, as well as generic methods. We learn about bounded generics < E extends C >, raw type < Object >, wildcards< ? >, erasure, and some restrictions in Generics  

## week3 - Abstract Data Type (ADT) and Bags
ADT is a data type where what the operations of the type are is public, while how the type is implemented is private.
Bags are the example of ADT.  

## week4 - Linked List
A linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence.  
We learn about how the linked list methods is implemented using nodes.
